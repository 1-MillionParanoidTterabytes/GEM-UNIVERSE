Final Project, Robert Seth - instructions on how to play.
-----------------------------------------------
With editor as host:

Open the editor, click play. Click Host (H) or the "H" key. 

Then open the "Build and Run the game into this folder" folder and click the "SimpleConcertSimulator.exe" 

Once that is up and you have clicked play, then click "LAN client" or C, this box should have a box on the right that reads "localhost"
------------------------------------------------
If you want to connect two separate computers, then go into "Bing" search engine and type "What's my Ip?" for the HOST player...
Sometimes, security systems will block the ip connection...

next, type that IP address into the box on the client player that says "localhost". After the IP is typed in, then click "LAN Client"
------------------------------------------------
The first 'stage' to reach 10 players 'wins'. If you do not want to connect 10 clients, simply copy and paste the 'Player' copies
in the editor. It checks for the 'player' tag and those copies have the tag. 
------------------------------------------------

Controls:
Left mouse, shoot a bullet, this should be spatialized so the furthur away from a player shooting, the quieter this sound is. 
WASD -> movement, SpaceBar -> Jump.

Shift + any key from{"QWERTYUIOP[]"} -> Play note. This only works if you are near an "instrument". Such as the boxes with the Google
Image trumpet PNG on them. Hit Shift + the numbers to play sharp/flatted notes. All 'instruments' play like synths with that soundfont
You cannot move while playing notes, this is intentional. Notes played are also spatialized some, but less noticable.

There is no Quit Game button, Alt + Tab, Alt + F4, Ctrl + Alt + Del... all should work; unlike Battle Royales, the bullets don't do anything...
